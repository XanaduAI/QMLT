The Quantum Machine Learning Toolbox (QMLT) is a `Strawberry Fields <https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields>`_ application that simplifies the optimization of variational quantum circuits. Tasks for the QMLT range from variational eigensolvers and unitary learning to supervised and unsupervised machine learning with models based on a variational circuit.

> Notice: This code will not necessarily be maintained to support further releases of Strawberry Fields and other dependencies. We welcome bug reports and PRs but make no guarantee about fixes or responses.


Features
========


The Quantum Machine Learning Toolbox supports:

* The training of user-provided variational circuits

* Automatic and numerical differentiation methods to compute gradients of circuit outputs

* Optimization, supervised and unsupervised learning tasks

* Regularization of circuit parameters

* Logging of training results

* Monitoring and visualization of training through matplotlib and TensorBoard

* Saving and restoring trained models

* Parallel computation/GPU usage for TensorFlow-based models

To get started, please see the online `documentation <https://qmlt.readthedocs.io>`_.
