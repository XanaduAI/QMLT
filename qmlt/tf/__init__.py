TF Quantum Circuit Learner
========================================================

**Module name:** :mod:`qmlt.tf`

.. currentmodule:: qmlt.tf

.. codeauthor:: Maria Schuld <maria@xanadu.ai>

This module contains a class to train models for machine learning and optimization based on variational quantum circuits.
The class extends TensorFlow's ``tf.estimator`` class, and adapts it to unsupervised learning and optimization tasks. It
hides the complexity of defining input functions, hooks and configurations.

The user defines a function that computes the outputs of the variational circuit, as well as the training objective,
and specifies the model and training hyperparameters.

There are three basic functionalities. The circuit can be trained, run with the current parameters, and scored.

The TensorFlow learner module has been designed for the training of continuous-variable circuits written in StrawberryFields or
BlackBird using the 'tf' backend only, but is in principle able to train any user-provided model coded in tensorflow.

In contrary to the Numerical Learner, TensorFlow doesn't have plotting functions. 
The easiest way to plot the parameters of the learner is by using [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard).
